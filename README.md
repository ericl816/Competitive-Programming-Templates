# Competitive-Programming-Templates
An useful collection of Data Structures and Algorithms implementation templates that anyone can use for Competitive Programming!

## Usage
Download this repo along with the necessary files (stdc++.h). When compiling C++ files locally, make sure to include stdc++.h and specify the path to that file in your include directive. <br/> <br/> E.g: This would be the include directive for Mac OS: ```#include "/Users/username/Desktop/Competitive-Programming-Templates/stdc++.h"```

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute to this repository by making a PR or emailing me your suggestions for which algorithms and data structures you want to see be implemented!
